SPI HUB for ESP32
=================
This repository contains the firmware source code and the hardware design
files.

The design is a fork of the ESP32 Brick from Tinkerforge : https://github.com/Tinkerforge/esp32-brick & https://www.tinkerforge.com/en/doc/Hardware/Bricks/ESP32_Brick.html

It is modified mainly to use "basic parts" components from JLCPCB for cost-effective assembly and also to use a ESP32 with external antenna (ESP32-WROOM-32UE-N16).

Hardware
--------

The hardware is designed with the open source EDA Suite KiCad 6.0 (http://www.kicad.org) and Kikit (https://github.com/yaqwsx/KiKit) is used to generate the assembly files.
